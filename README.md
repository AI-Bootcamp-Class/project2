### Requirements

#### Data Model Implementation (25 points)

*   There is a Jupyter notebook that thoroughly describes the data extraction, cleaning, and transformation process, and the cleaned data is exported as CSV files for the machine learning model. (10 points)
    
*   A Python script initializes, trains, and evaluates a model or loads a pretrained model. (10 points)
    
*   The model demonstrates meaningful predictive power, at least 75% classification accuracy or 0.80 R-squared. (5 points)
    

#### Data Model Optimization (25 points)

*   The model optimization and evaluation process showing iterative changes made to the model and the resulting changes in model performance is documented in either a CSV/Excel table or in the Python script itself. (15 points)
    
*   Overall model performance is printed or displayed at the end of the script. (10 points)
    

#### GitHub Documentation (25 points)

*   GitHub repository is free of unnecessary files and folders and has an appropriate .gitignore in use. (10 points)
    
*   The README is customized as a polished presentation of the content of the project. (15 points)
    

#### Presentation Requirements (25 points)

Your presentation should cover the following:

*   An executive summary or overview of the project and project goals. (5 points)
    
*   An overview of the data collection, cleanup, and exploration processes. (5 points)
    
*   The approach that your group took in achieving the project goals. (5 points)
    
*   Any additional questions that surfaced, what your group might research next if more time was available, or share a plan for future development. (3 points)
    
*   The results and conclusions of the application or analysis. (3 points)
    
*   Slides effectively demonstrate the project. (2 points)
    
*   Slides are visually clean and professional. (2 points)
